# About

    This project was done to give a user a way to search the current weather and also present them with a five day forecast for the city that they lookup.

    The way the project works is when someone opens the webpage they are presented with an easy interface to search the weather forecast.

    When a city is searched, the user will be presented with the following information along with their city search - 

    The current weather for that day
    The Temperature
    The Wind Speed
    The UV Index  

    Below the user is also presented with a Five Day Forecast that will present the same city's weather conditions for the next 5 days
    
    Previously searched cities will be presented under the search box and can be cleared as well.
